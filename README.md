#Recursion
Recursion Projects from [TOP's ](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby curriculum. More information [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion?ref=lnav)

#Project 1: Fibonacci
Write a method `#fibs` which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.

Now write another method `#fibs_rec` which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you're crazy, but don't consider either of these lengths a requirement... just get it done).

#Project 2: Merge Sort
Build a method `#merge_sort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
